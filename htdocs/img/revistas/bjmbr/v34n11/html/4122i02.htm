 Figure 2. Hydrolysis of the oxidized &szlig;-chain of insulin by ZapA. A solution of oxidized &szlig;-chain (20 &#181;M) was incubated with 2.8 pM purified native ZapA in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 2 mM CaCl<SUB>2</SUB>, pH 8.0, at 37&#186;C for 3 h. The hydrolysis products were analyzed by HPLC as described in Material and Methods. The chromatogram in <I>panel B</I> shows the profile of the intact polypeptide, and <I>panel C</I> shows the production of the fragments generated by the incubation with ZapA. The bonds cleaved by ZapA, indicated by arrows in the sequence of the &szlig;-chain of insulin (panel<I> </I>A), were determined by mass spectrometry as described in Material and Methods. <!-- $MVD$:face("Symbol") --><FONT FACE="Symbol">&#175;</FONT> = known cleavage sites; <!-- $MVD$:face("Symbol") --><FONT FACE="Symbol">&szlig;</FONT> = newly detected cleavage site.</BODY>
