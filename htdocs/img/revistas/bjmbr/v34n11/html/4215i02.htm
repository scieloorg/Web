 Figure 2. <I>In vivo</I> expression of <I>nif'-'lacZ</I> from the <I>nifE</I> (E) and <I>nifH</I> (H) promoters in the <I>E. coli </I>MC1061 strain in the presence (+ NifA) or absence of the NifA activator protein provided by pCK3 plasmid. Expression of <I>nif'-'lacZ</I> fusion was measured as a function of the OD<SUB>600</SUB> for cultures grown in A medium (see Material and Methods). In each case, three data points (between OD<SUB>600</SUB> of 0.2 and 0.6) were used to determine the slope of the line, which reflects the differential rate of <I>nif'-'lacZ</I> expression. Curve labeled MC (which overlaps the curve from the <I>nifH</I> promoter in the absence of NifA) gives data for the <I>E. coli</I> MC1061 host strain (negative control).</BODY>
