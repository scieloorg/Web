 Figure 1. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activities in epididymal adipose tissue (A) and in heart (B), soleus (C) and diaphragm (D) muscles during progressive starvation and refeeding after 24-h starvation. Tissue LPL activities (mean &#177; SEM) were measured in homogenates obtained from Wistar rats starved for 48 h (N = 6), starved for 24 h (N = 10), refed/fasted 0 h (N = 6), refed/fasted 4 h (N = 6), and refed <I>ad libitum </I>(N = 10). *P&lt;0.05 for starved <I>vs</I> refed groups; **P&lt;0.05 <I>vs</I> other groups (unpaired Student <I>t</I>-test).</BODY>
