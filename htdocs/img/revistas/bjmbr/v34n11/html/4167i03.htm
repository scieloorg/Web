 Figure 3. The effect of ethnicity and genetic model on the recommended sample size for a fixed odds ratio (2.0) for the respective genotypic association. As shown, sample size is strongly dependent on both relative risk of the variant for the development of the studied phenotype, ethnicity and genetic model of action, particularly when clustering studies are taken. ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme; ATG = angiotensinogen.</BODY>
