 Figure 3. <I>A</I> and <I>B</I>, Scatter plots of the relationship between the best-estimated C<SUB>max</SUB> (&#181;g/ml) of 4-methylaminoantipyrine (MAA; abscissa) and the C<SUB>max</SUB> derived from the 2-point limited-sampling strategy (LSS) models for each volunteer (ordinate), using the jack-knife approach (Methods). <I>Panel A</I>, Formulation A, data for 2 and 3 h. <I>Panel B</I>, Formulation B, data for 1.5 and 2 h. <I>C</I>, Scatter plot of the relationship between the best-estimated C<SUB>max</SUB> (&#181;g/ml) of MAA for dipyrone formulation A (abscissa) and the C<SUB>max</SUB> derived using the 2-point LSS model developed for formulation B and the concentrations observed at the same respective times, but after administration of formulation A (ordinate). The continuous line in each plot represents the line of identity between the LSS-derived and the best-estimated C<SUB>max</SUB>.<SUB> </SUB>C<SUB>max</SUB> = peak plasma concentration.</BODY>
