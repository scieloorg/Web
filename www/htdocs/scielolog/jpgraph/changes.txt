Changelog for JpGraph
=====================

[29-Apr-2001] JpGraph 1.2.2
===========================
Bug fixes:
* Removed reference to non-existent property 'bypass' in class RotImg
* Changed to allow the last X-gridline to be drawn (comparison with limit was '<'
  where it should have been '<=' )

Additions:
* Added possibility to use background image
* Added possibility to use approximate color through the "USE_APPROX_COLORS"
  constant
* Handling of diffrent form of "null values" for line graphs. An y-value
  can now be "" or "-". In the first case (a true null value) this mark
  will cause a disruption in the line graph to indicate that the value
  is undefined. In the other case specifying the value as "-" will cause
  the value to be ignored bu the line will still be drawn between the
  previous data point and the following. Neither of these cases will have
  any mark drawn.
* Added a fatal warning when no more colors can be allocated for the chosen 
  graphic format.

Changes:
* "Downgraded" anti-aliasing algorithm to use fewer color levels
  in the transition to avoid using up to much of the color palette
* Cleaned up some of the code to not rely on PHP default initialization
  of variables. This will help those who have got warnings when they
  have had all error reporting enabled in php.ini (E_ALL)
* Legends now show the plot mark (if defined) instead of just a square of
  the right color.

Acknowledgements:
* Thanks to kevin@pricetrak.com  for suggesting the treatment of 
  pure NULL values.
* Thanks to luca_n@hotmail.com for getting my attention to the warnings
  caused by relying on PHP default initialization of variables.  
  (My installation had E_NOTICE disabled, hence I never got those warning myself.)


[29-Mar-2001] JpGraph 1.2.1
===========================
Bug fixes:
* When min and max values for autoscaling was equal this resulted in trying to calculate
  log10(0) = INF resulting in an infinite loop in LinearTicks::Stroke()
* When autoscaling was used with only one data point it tried to calculate log10(0) = INF
  resulting in an infinite loop
* fopen("xxx","r") should be fopen("xxx","rb") causes problems on windows system with IIS5
* JPG streaming function was incorrectly called "imagejpg" should be "imagejpeg" (see the difference?)
* Non existent color name in jpgraph_pie.php
* Removed all deprecated forced references in function calls
* The width of the surrunding box was not calculated correctly for internal bold font

Additions:
* Color themes for pie graphs
* Beta release of 3D pie graphs
* Added DIR_BASE as constant to make it possible to use one system wide copy
of JpGraph. NOTE: This must be set to the directory where JpGraph is installed.

Acknowledgements:
* (ck1@wwwtech.de) (and a russian guy which I unfortunately lost the name of) 
  for reporting the imagejpg spelling mistake
* (ales.gregor@zps.skoda-auto.cz) for finding the binary file problem with IIS
* Several people have reported the problem with autoscaling when all Y-values 
  were equal. Thanks to you all for acting as my privet QA team!


[18-Mar-2001] JpGraph 1.2
=========================
Additions:
----------
* Added "BRAND_TIMING" which give possibility to brand each image generated with
the time (in ms) it took to generate the image.
* Added Gradient Fill for bar graphs, The gradient fill allows 6 different styles.
* Added Anti-aliasing for lines. Note drawing anti-aliased lines is 7-10 times 
slower then "normal" lines!
* Added full TTF support. this means an internal SC break (Source Code Break). Normal JpGraph
script should not be affected if you have used only publized "public" frunctions. The SC break is
to allow uniform treatment of both internal fonts and TTF. This has been achieved by changing
the parameter list for SetFont(). However, backward compatibility with the old naming conventions
for internal fonts are kepot, e.g. SetFont(FONT1_BOLD) still works but is deprecated and will not
be valid from 2.0 
* Added possibility to control font for title of Spider Axis through the added
property 'title' to the axis in the spider graph.
* Added 'SetColor()' in pie graphs as a shortcut to SetMarginColor() to set the background color
* Added possibility to draw X-axis labels at arbitrary angle. Internal fonts only supports
horizontal and verical.
* Added possibility to draw boxed text at an angle
* Added possibility to have different colors for axis and the labels on the axis by the addition 
of extra parameter to SetColor()
* Added 350 more named colors.
* Added canvas "fake" graph to make it easy to draw arbitrary graphics
* Added SetCenter() method for line graphs.
* Added SetGrace() for autoscaling purposes.

Changes:
--------
* If you use a text-scale for X-axis the default labels now start at 1 instead of 0 since this is 
actually a counting scale and it makes more sense to start at 1.
* Improved handling of bar-graphs with negative values.
* Updated existing examples to use new format for SetFont()
* Made it a critical error to specify a non existant font
* Changed so that orientation for Text() is now given as an angle, i.e. SetOrientation(45). Old
style of using SetOrientation("v") (for vertical) is deprecated. But will work until V2

Bug fixes:
----------
* Improved handling of computational effects on small values in scaling where a rounding error might cause the
last label not to be drawn.
* The position for the title of X-axis could in some cases be slightly different in first
and second pass due to incorrectly determination of the X-axis labels font height.
* Specifying an minimum Y-value for Y-axis on bar graphs could on rare occasions (combination 
of scale values and specified density of autoscaling ticks) cause a gap between the bottom of 
each bar and the X-axis.


[18-Feb-2001] JpGraph 1.1
=========================
Additions/Changes:
------------------
* Added Spider graphs 
* Added Pie graph
* Added Scatter (and impuls) graphs
* Added possibility to rotate plots an arbitrary angle
* Added step style rendering to lineplot
* Added Breseham circle drawing which gives better visual apperance
  then the built in Arc() in GD (on the expense of CPU and performance)
* Improved Polygon and Rectangle drawing so that it will use line weight settings
* Improved the visual appearance of lines with weight>1 by correctly calculating 
  (angle wise) the endpoints and using a filled polygon to draw the line. 
  Unfortunately it would require some real improvements in the GD library to really improve
  the visual appeance of lines with weight>1. This is as good as it gets without writing
  a low level pixe-by-pixel correct plotting. With my method you get it to look visually
  aestethic right in 90% of the cases with just 10% work. 
* Added MARK_FILLEDCIRCLE as new mark type. Note that due too the poor performance of the
  basic Arc() image primitive in PHP4 the circles isn't perfect circles, they tend to be a
  a little bit flat at multiples on PI/2.
* Added the possibility to have a separate fill- and line- color for marks
* Moved Class PlotMark from jpgraph_line.php to base in jpgraph.php since this class is also used
  with scatter plots. 
* Made it a critical error to try to use Text X-scale with specified X-data points. 
  Previously no warning was given for this non-defined state. (Using text scale with specified
  points really doesn't make sense.)
* Made it a critical error to use unknown color rather than silently replacing it with black.
* Updated documentation to reflect added capability


Bug fixes:
----------
* Fixed minor bug in Line() in which it didn't update the last point for use with
  subsequent LineTo() calls (forgotten $this->) 
* Eliminated assumptions in DashedLine() that x1<=x2 and y1<=y2 eliminates the 
  potential pixel overshoot.  
* Fixed a serious bug in Line plot when used with a specified X-scale (not the normal default)
  since the X-coordinate wasn't read from the correct vector!
* Fixed a serious bug whe using as specified X-scale since the maximum value for a plot 
  wasn't correctly passed to the autoscaling. 
  Note: The reason that these two bugs haven't been discovered previously is the fact 
  that my test specs didn't include test cases to do with specified X-axis (I almost never ever use that). 
  This has now been corrected and added to the test suit. 
* Fixed so the possible box around the plot area correctly honours the weight specified for it.


[05-Feb-2001] JpGraph 1.0
=========================
* Initial release.
